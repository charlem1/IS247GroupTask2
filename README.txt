Charles Martins, Hridaya Koirala, Brandon Mclarin, Myona Moore Group Task 2

The goal of this task is to create a list of fruit that the user can add and remove different kinds of fruit from. This project features an 
ArrayList that implements a list interface. This is an optimal method of collecting information about different kinds of fruit. It
removes duplicates created in the list and checks for duplicates using the contains() method.
It also includes a Stack to reverse the list without any duplicates. Essentially it will remove double listings in the list if needed. 
Finally, the project will display the final reversed list making the inputted items a lot more readable and organized
